# StrataFusion Tasks

## DriveUI Component Architectural Improvements

### Component Structure

- [x] Split DriveUI into smaller components (current component is 500+ lines)
  - [x] Create DriveHeader component (navigation, breadcrumbs, actions)
  - [x] Create DriveTable component (file/folder listing)
  - [x] Create DriveToolbar component (search, filters, view options)
  - [ ] Only allow for one instance of a service account at a time.
  - [ ] Create DriveEmptyState component (for empty folders/search results)
  - [x] Create DriveErrorState component (for error handling)

### Logic Extraction

- [ ] Extract complex logic into custom hooks
  - [ ] Create useDriveNavigation hook (folder navigation, breadcrumb management)
  - [ ] Create useDriveItems hook (fetching and filtering items)
  - [ ] Create useDriveSearch hook (search functionality)
  - [ ] Create useDriveUpload hook (file upload operations)

### TypeScript Improvements

- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript interfaces
  - [ ] Move DriveItem and related interfaces to a separate types file
  - [ ] Create proper discriminated unions for different item types
  - [ ] Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for better developer experience

### State Management

- [ ] Improve state management
  - [ ] Reduce local component state in favor of context
  - [ ] Consider using a more robust state management solution for complex state
  - [ ] Implement proper loading/error states with skeleton loaders

### Performance

- [ ] Enhance performance
  - [ ] Implement virtualization for large file lists
  - [ ] Add pagination support for folders with many items
  - [ ] Optimize re-renders with memoization (useMemo, useCallback)
  - [ ] Implement proper data caching strategy

### Error Handling

- [ ] Improve error handling
  - [ ] Create a consistent error handling strategy
  - [ ] Add retry mechanisms for failed API calls
  - [ ] Implement proper error boundaries

### Testing

- [ ] Add comprehensive testing
  - [ ] Write unit tests for all extracted hooks
  - [ ] Write component tests for UI elements
  - [ ] Write integration tests for the full DriveUI component
  - [ ] Add Storybook stories for all new components

### Accessibility

- [ ] Improve accessibility
  - [ ] Ensure proper keyboard navigation
  - [ ] Add ARIA attributes for screen readers
  - [ ] Implement focus management
  - [ ] Test with screen readers

### API Interaction

- [ ] Refactor API interaction
  - [ ] Create a dedicated API client for drive operations
  - [ ] Implement proper request/response types
  - [ ] Add request cancellation for aborted operations
