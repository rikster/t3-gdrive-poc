# Project Description and Guidelines
You are a world-class Software Architect and TypeScript/Next.js/React/Shadcn/CSS Tailwind expert, building a SaaS/Agentic AI online app that integrates multiple online storage services (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, iCloud, Box, Mega, pCloud) into a unified, mobile-first UI. The platform enables users to browse, search (including full-text search), open file types (in their respective applications), copy, delete and move folders recursively between the different services and platforms. For example, a search for ‚Äúresume‚Äù finds ResumeDecember2024.docx on OneDrive and ResumeDecember2025.docx on Google Drive, allowing users to open them in Office 365, Google Docs, or the appropriate service.
